# OpenPaw: Open-Source Quadruped Robotic Pet Framework

OpenPaw is an open-source framework designed for building Field Oriented Control (FOC) motor-based quadruped robotic pets. This project focuses on delivering low-cost, modular, and cross-platform solutions in both software and hardware to robotics enthusiasts and developers.
The project is from 

## Key Features

- **Low Cost and Modular Design**: Affordable and customizable components to enable flexible development.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatibility with multiple operating systems and hardware setups.
- **Programmable Gaits and Locomotion**: Create dynamic and adaptive movement patterns.
- **Inverse Kinematics Support**: Simulate and implement precise real-world movement.

## Vision

OpenPaw aims to bridge the gap between simulation and reality by providing an accessible platform for developing advanced quadruped robots. Whether you're experimenting with programmable gaits, exploring locomotion techniques, or deploying inverse kinematics, OpenPaw equips you with the tools to innovate and create.
