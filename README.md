# OpenPaw: Open-Source Quadruped Robotic Pet Framework

OpenPaw is an open-source framework designed for building Field Oriented Control (FOC) motor-based quadruped robotic pets. This project focuses on delivering low-cost, modular, and cross-platform solutions in both software and hardware to robotics enthusiasts and developers.

## Our Philosophy

OpenPaw is a project created by and for the open-source community. We believe in the principles of transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By sharing our work, we hope to contribute to the growth of the robotics ecosystem and empower others to build upon it.

## Key Features

- **Low Cost and Modular Design**: Affordable and customizable components to enable flexible development.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatibility with multiple operating systems and hardware setups.
- **Programmable Gaits and Locomotion**: Create dynamic and adaptive movement patterns.
- **Inverse Kinematics Support**: Simulate and implement precise real-world movement.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements
